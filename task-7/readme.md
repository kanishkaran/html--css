# Task 7: State-of-the-Art Carousel

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **responsive image carousel** created using HTML and CSS. The carousel supports both auto-sliding and manual navigation.

## Features

- **Auto-Sliding**:
  - The carousel automatically transitions between slides every 12 seconds.
- **Manual Navigation**:
  - Users can navigate between slides using the navigation dots.
- **Pause on Hover**:
  - The auto-sliding animation pauses when the user hovers over the carousel.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - The carousel adapts to different screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. The carousel will start auto-sliding through the images.
3. Use the navigation dots below the carousel to manually switch between slides.

## Placeholder Images

The project uses placeholder images from [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos). You can replace these with your own images by updating the `src` attributes in the `index.html` file.
